# Practicum
In this practicume will are going to test some of your skills working with Github, Angular, NgRx and clean code practices. 

You will start by duplicating the repository, then fixing few bugs, adding a simple feature, and finaly duing some code reivew. 

## Part 1: Setting up your repository
1. First you need to create a new GitHub **private** repository 
2. Next, please **duplicate** this repository to your newly created one
   you can follow these instructions how to [duplicate a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository)
  
    (Do **not** fork. If you do you will not be able to change the repo to _private_)

## Part 2: 
  - ## Bug fixing
    Each bug designed to test a different Angular skill. You will find all the information and instructions in each issue:
    [Bug 1](https://github.com/natanbr/angular-practicum/issues/1)
    [Bug 2](https://github.com/natanbr/angular-practicum/issues/2)
    [Bug 3](https://github.com/natanbr/angular-practicum/issues/3)
  - ## New feature
    you are required to implement a global notification. In this [feature request](https://github.com/natanbr/angular-practicum/issues/4) you will find all the requirements and an example. 
  - ## Code review
    Lastly, in this part you are required to do a quick code review.
  Our goal is to see if you can recognize all the problematic and "smelly" code issues. 
    - ### Instructions:
      1. Create a new pull request of `code-review-task` into `main` branch
      2. Navigate to that pull request and add your review as comments
    - ### Tips:
      - In your daly work you will create code review request and you will review other developers code. Think of this as a real review you are doing to one of your co-workers.
      - You are **NOT** required to understand or refactor the logic, you just need to suggest the developer what you think he should do to improve the quality of his code.
      - You don't need to repeat the same comment in each line you find the same problem, Single example for each issue you find is sufficient. 

## When you done
Please give dominique@blockchaingroup.io and nathan.braslavski@blockchaingroup.io
access to your private repo.

### To Compile:

#### using `yarn`
run the project install the dependencies by running the command `yarn` and to run the development server use `yarn start`

**Good luck!**
